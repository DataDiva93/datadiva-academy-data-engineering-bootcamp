# 🎙️ Week 3 Video Transcript – Data Modeling Fundamentals

---

## Welcome

Hey Data Fam 👋🏽 Welcome to Week 3 of the Data Diva Academy Bootcamp.

This is one of my favorite weeks — because this is where data finally 
starts to make *sense.*  
We’re going beyond raw data, beyond pipelines, and looking at **how to 
structure data** in a way that scales, supports analysis, and drives 
business insights.

## What is Data Modeling?

Data modeling is the process of designing how data should be stored, 
connected, and accessed in a database.  
It’s the foundation for how analytics, apps, and AI can work efficiently.

When done well, data modeling:
- Reduces redundancy  
- Improves query performance  
- Makes systems easier to understand and manage

## Three Types of Models

Let’s break it down:

- **Conceptual Model**: High-level. What entities exist and how they 
relate. Think: big-picture.  
- **Logical Model**: Adds detail like attributes and relationships.  
- **Physical Model**: How it’s actually implemented in a real system 
(datatypes, constraints, indexes).

Each one builds on the last.

## Why It Matters

If your schema is messy, your pipelines will break, and your analysts will 
struggle.  
But with a solid model, teams can trust the data and build confidently on 
top of it.

Great data engineers *think like architects.*  
They anticipate how data will grow, change, and be used across the 
organization.

## Real-World Example

Imagine a retail company.

You’ll have tables for:
- Products  
- Customers  
- Orders  
- Payments  

Each one relates to the others. Your job?  
Map those relationships, reduce duplication, and make sure every column 
has purpose.

## Assignment Overview

This week, you’ll:
- Design a basic data model (ERD-style)  
- Normalize it to 3NF  
- Write out a simple schema in SQL  
- Reflect on how your structure could scale

## Final Thoughts

You’ve made it halfway through the bootcamp, and now you’re learning to 
design the engine that powers clean, beautiful data.

Own your architect brain. You were built for this 💜
