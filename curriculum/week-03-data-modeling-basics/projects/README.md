# 📚 Week 3: Data Modeling Fundamentals

Welcome to Week 3 of the **Data Diva Academy** Data Engineering Bootcamp!  
This week, we’re diving into one of the most essential skills of a data 
engineer: how to properly design and model data structures for analytics, 
reporting, and long-term storage.

## 👩🏽‍💻 Your Mission This Week

This is the week we shift from “what is data” to “how should it live.”  
You’ll design your own schema from scratch, practice normalization, and 
walk away with a foundational understanding of how great data engineering 
starts with great modeling.

Let’s structure this thing 💪🏽
