# 🎙️ Week 1 Video Transcript – Intro to Data Engineering

---

## Welcome

Hey Data Divas and Dudes! 👋🏽 Welcome to Week 1 of the Data Diva Academy 
Bootcamp.

This week, we’re diving into what it means to be a data engineer, what 
responsibilities come with the role, and how you fit into the modern data 
team. This lesson sets the tone for everything you’ll learn going forward, 
so take your time, take notes, and trust yourself.

## What is Data Engineering?

Data engineering is the foundation of all data-driven decisions. Without 
clean, reliable data pipelines, analytics and AI can’t happen. We’re the 
builders who make sure data flows from source to insight.

---

## Key Responsibilities

Here are some core things data engineers do:

- Design and build ETL/ELT pipelines  
- Work with tools like SQL, Python, dbt, Airflow  
- Move data from systems into warehouses  
- Ensure data is clean, reliable, and accessible  
- Collaborate with analysts, scientists, and dev teams  

---

## Common Tools

You’ll hear these tools a lot throughout the bootcamp:

- SQL  
- Python  
- Apache Airflow  
- Azure Data Factory  
- AWS Glue  
- dbt  
- Snowflake, Redshift, or BigQuery  

We’ll get hands-on with many of these as we build together.

## Role Comparison

| Role           | Focus               | Tools             |
|----------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Data Engineer  | Infrastructure, ETL | SQL, Python, dbt   |
| Data Analyst   | Business Insights    | Excel, Power BI    |
| Data Scientist | Prediction, Modeling | Python, Jupyter    |

Each role plays an important part. Data Engineers build the infrastructure 
and pipelines that the rest rely on.

## Real-World Example

In healthcare, data engineers help route patient record data from hospital 
systems into a unified warehouse. This enables analysts and data 
scientists to detect patterns in treatment effectiveness, cost savings, 
and patient outcomes.

You’ll build your own version of this in the coming weeks.

## Assignment Overview

This week’s lab is reflective and research-based. You’ll:

- Define data engineering in your own words  
- Compare it to analysts and scientists  
- Choose an industry (healthcare, retail, fintech, etc.) and research a 
real-world use case  
- Reflect on what excites you most about this path

## Final Thoughts

The best part? You don’t have to learn it all at once. You just need to 
show up, stay curious, and trust your process.

Let’s build. Let’s explore. Let’s level up. 💪🏽
