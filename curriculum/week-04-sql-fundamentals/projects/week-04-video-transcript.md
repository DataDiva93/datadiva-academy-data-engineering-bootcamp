# 🎙️ Week 4 Video Transcript – SQL Fundamentals

---

## Welcome

Hey Data Divas and Dudes 👋🏽  
Welcome to Week 4 — the halfway mark in your bootcamp journey!

This week is about one thing: **SQL fluency**.  
SQL is the universal language of databases — and being comfortable with it 
is non-negotiable for any data engineer, analyst, or scientist.

## What is SQL?

SQL stands for Structured Query Language.  
It’s used to access, manipulate, and manage data in relational databases.

If you’ve ever asked, “Show me all customers from Atlanta who ordered last 
month,” SQL is how you’d get that answer.

## The Big 5 Commands

You’ll start by mastering the big 5:

- `SELECT`: Retrieve data  
- `INSERT`: Add new data  
- `UPDATE`: Modify existing data  
- `DELETE`: Remove data  
- `CREATE`: Define tables and structures

This is what we call **CRUD** — Create, Read, Update, Delete.

---

## Writing a Basic Query

Here’s a simple SQL query:

```sql
SELECT name, department
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 80000
ORDER BY name ASC;
```

This would return all employees making more than $80K, sorted by name.

## Practice Makes Fluent

This week, we’ll be writing a lot of queries.  
You’ll be inserting fake records, filtering results, and updating values.

You’ll also practice functions like:

- `COUNT()`  
- `SUM()`  
- `AVG()`  
- `MAX()`  
- `MIN()`

You’re going to get comfortable talking to your data.

## Assignment Overview

You’ll:

- Create a table schema  
- Insert sample data  
- Write queries using `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, and `LIMIT`  
- Practice writing CRUD statements  
- Share your reflections and GitHub link in Discord

## Final Thoughts

Learning SQL is like learning a superpower — it gives you direct access to 
the answers your team needs.

And the more fluent you become, the more powerful your impact will be 💡

Let’s get querying!
