# ðŸ’» Challenge 1: Build a Data Model from Scratch

Imagine you're designing a model for a music streaming app.

You need to store data for:

- Users  
- Artists  
- Songs  
- Playlists  
- Streams  

Draw a basic ERD using Lucidchart or DrawSQL.  
Bonus: Normalize your design to 3NF.

Push your SQL + ERD screenshot to GitHub as `music-schema.sql` and 
`music-erd.png`
